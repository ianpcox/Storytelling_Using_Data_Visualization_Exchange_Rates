# VIZ_Storytelling_Data_Visualization_Exchange_Rates
A visualization-driven analysis of exchange rates highlighting three distinct stories: 1) How the euro-dollar rate has changed during the coronavirus pandemic; 2) The 2020 data and the 2016-2019 data as a baseline for analysis; 3) How the euro-dollar rate changed during the 2007-2008's financial crisis. We can also show the data for 2016 and 2009 for comparison; we can use a line plot.      We show comparatively how the euro-dollar rate changed under the last three US presidents (George W. Bush (2001-2009), Barack Obama (2009-2017), and Donald Trump (2017-2021)).
